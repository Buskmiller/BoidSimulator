# Carbon Fork - Boid Simulator
This is a program I wrote to simulate bird-oid entities interacting with each other and their environment to observe emergent behavior. It uses a couple of SDL libraries to render the background, text, textbox, and boids. I did not have any part in creating the SDL libraries that I used. I did not alter the SDL libraries, either.


    SDL 2.0 and newer are available under the zlib license :

Furthermore, the code I wrote falls under a slightly modified version of the Don't be a Dick public license:
   
   ```

1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.

   Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

 1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.
 1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.
 1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.

2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's
creator a glass of milk.

3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes
you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back.
